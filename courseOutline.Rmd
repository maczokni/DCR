##Aims
The course aims to promote and enhance knowledge, skills and confidence in designing and conducting empirical criminological research. It offers both introductory and advanced sessions focussing on research as process and culminates in an assessed dissertation proposal.
The course also aims to complement existing dedicated units on quantitative and qualitative data analysis and promote greater engagement and quality in the summer dissertation.

##Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
 
- understand the nature of social (criminological) research as a reflexive process
- formulate original research questions and select research designs suitable for addressing them
- develop their emerging ideas for the summer dissertation
- be able to critically engage with high level methodology, and gain more from their reading on the degree as a whole

##Teaching and learning methods
- 5 x 2-hour sessions for the first five weeks, then 3 practical sessions. 
- Sessions will be interactive, involving a mix of group-work, problem-solving and debates, using multi-media materials where relevant.

##Assessment
- The assessment for this course is a project proposal for the dissertation.  
- Sessions will be interactive, involving a mix of group-work, problem-solving and debates, using multi-media materials where relevant.

* The reserach process
    + Identifying the problem
    + Research design
    + Data Collection
    + Data analysis

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
