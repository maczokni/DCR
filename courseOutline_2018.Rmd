Welcome to LAWS70311: Designing Criminological Research. This course outline should give you an overview of what we will cover in this course.

# Aims
The course aims to promote and enhance knowledge, skills and confidence in designing and conducting empirical criminological research. It offers both introductory and advanced sessions focussing on research as process and culminates in an assessed dissertation proposal.
The course also aims to complement existing dedicated units on quantitative and qualitative data analysis and promote greater engagement and quality in the summer dissertation.

# Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
 
- understand the nature of social (criminological) research as a reflexive process
- formulate original research questions and select research designs suitable for addressing them
- develop their emerging ideas for the summer dissertation
- be able to critically engage with high level methodology, and gain more from their reading on the degree as a whole

# Teaching and learning methods

The structure is as follows: 

- 6 x 2-hour sessions for the first five weeks, then 2 practical sessions. 
- Sessions will be interactive, involving a mix of group-work, problem-solving and debates, using multi-media materials where relevant.

Students will be expected to have done the required preparation before classes, in order to be able to make the most of the sessions

# Assessment

- The assessment for this course is a project proposal for the dissertation.  
- Sessions will be interactive, involving a mix of group-work, problem-solving and debates, using multi-media materials where relevant.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
